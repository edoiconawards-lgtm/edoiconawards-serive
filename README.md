# edoiconawards-serive
Edo Icon Award is an honours/awards scheme set up to celebrate people from Edo State (or associated with Edo) who have excelled in various fields — government, business, media, public service, private sector, etc.   The idea is to recognize “exceptional performances … and to encourage recipients to do more.”
